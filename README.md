## 📌 Features

* Configured multiple server types:

  * ✅ **DNS Server** for domain name resolution
  * ✅ **DHCP Server** for dynamic IP allocation
  * ✅ **Web Server** for hosting a basic website
  * ✅ **Mail Server** for internal email communication
  * ✅ **FTP Server** for file sharing
* Set up client-side devices to interact with all servers
* Demonstrated routing and IP addressing within a simulated LAN
* Documented configuration steps and testing outcomes
